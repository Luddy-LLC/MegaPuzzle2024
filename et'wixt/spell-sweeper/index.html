                <p>The Et'Wixt Government have taken to burrying some rather nasty spells in defense of their city in times of crisis, and unfortunately they often fail to do their due diligence in retreiving these powerful hexes once the crisis has passed. It has become such a prevalent issue that they've integrated a detection system such that the spells emit an aura in every direction but up in addition to handing out these guides to identifying the spell's locations by aura when they might be encountered by civilians. These auras even compound based on how many spells are nearby, becoming more potent the more spells are directly nearby.</p> 
                <p>It seems that this effort perhaps should have used to reduce the problem itself and clean the spells, but the system does ameliorate some of the issue. That is, if you dig everywhere you walk, of course. It's actually become common for the more cautious and well-off citizens of Et'Wixt to purchase a specially trained spell-sniffing dog which can pick up the faint smell of these auras under the ground and alert their owner. Due to the volativity of the spells in question it is not recommended for anyone  to attempt to smell the different auras themselves to differentiate them.</p>
                <p>Although the cleanup leaves much to be desired, the actual use of these spells in combat have been highly effective from what I've heard. You can get rather creative with the spells, and it's actually very difficult to detect them on flat terrain unless you're a relatively powerful sorcerer.</p>
